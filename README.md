## how to enter a funtion :
On the first tab "Draw" in the TextField you can enter your personal function,<br><br>
First write the name of your fonction (lets call it "f"),<br><br>
Nextchoose the variable used in your function (we take "(x)" here),<br><br>
After put an equal ( "=" ),<br><br>
Choose a cool expression ( "sin(x^2)" for today),<br><br>
Put an other equal,<br><br>
Finally select the interval inside you want the function to be drawn and a step(the function will be displayed ♪ step by step ♪,<br><br>
We draw the function between "-5;5",<br><br>
And we choose a step of ";0.1",<br><br>
So we have : "f(x) = sin(x^2) = 0;5;0.1".<br><br>
